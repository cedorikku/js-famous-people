          Bronny James is currently a rookie basketball player for the Los
          Angeles Lakers, drafted 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft. This makes
          him and his father, LeBron James Sr., the first ever father-son duo to
          be active teammates in the NBA. Bronny James's 2024 NBA draft experience 
          was a whirlwind. Despite the Lakers having a higher pick, speculation 
          swirled around which team would select him. The rumors of interest from
          the Dallas Mavericks added to the drama. Then, in a surprise move, the
          Lakers used their 55th pick to reunite Bronny with his father, LeBron James
          Sr., creating NBA history as the first father-son duo.
